## **⚠️ The Challenge in Agile Development & JIRA**  
🔹 **Manual JIRA Overhead** – Creating, refining, and managing JIRA tickets is time-consuming  
🔹 **Slow Transition from Requirements to Code** – Converting user stories into actual UI/backend logic requires multiple iterations  
🔹 **Development Bottlenecks** – Dependencies, unclear requirements, and PR delays slow progress  
🔹 **Limited Test Automation** – Manual test case writing, UI testing, and API validation take excessive effort  
🔹 **Backend & API Development Delays** – Poor schema planning, endpoint inconsistencies, and inefficiencies
