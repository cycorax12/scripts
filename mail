Implement a function that determines a color indicator (green, amber, red) to reflect sprint health.

Inputs:
- `timePercent`: percentage of sprint time completed (0–100)
- `donePercent`: percentage of work marked as "Done" in Jira (0–100)

Logic:
- If `timePercent` is 10% or less, return "gray" (too early to assess).
- Calculate `progressRatio = donePercent / timePercent`
- Return:
  - "green" if ratio >= 0.9 (on track)
  - "amber" if ratio is between 0.5 and 0.9 (slightly behind)
  - "red" if ratio < 0.5 (at risk)

Include an example usage with dummy values for testing.
