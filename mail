Subject: Migration to Apache APISIX Gateway â€“ Rationale and Next Steps

Hi Team,

We will be moving to Apache APISIX as our API Gateway and service discovery solution, replacing Spring Cloud Gateway and Discovery.

We have completed a basic POC and will proceed with integrating APISIX into aspen-event-resolver, which will call business rules behind the APISIX gateway.

Why this change helps:

Reduced library bloat: We can remove multiple Spring Cloud libraries from our services, reducing dependency complexity and potential security patch management.

Lightweight gateway management: APISIX is external to our Spring Boot apps, providing a decoupled and centralised API gateway with advanced routing, plugin-based extensibility, and better performance.

Easier upgrades and maintenance: No direct coupling with Spring Cloud versions, simplifying Spring Boot upgrades in the future.

Enhanced observability and traffic management: APISIX offers native support for traffic splitting, rate limiting, monitoring, and security plugins, reducing our in-app implementation burden.

We will share detailed integration, deployment steps, and required changes in upcoming working sessions. Please reach out if you foresee any immediate blockers or dependencies to address before migration.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
