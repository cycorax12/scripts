I built an OpenShift Migration Tool that helps developers seamlessly migrate workloads from DeploymentConfig to Deployments, reducing manual effort and errors. I also developed Smart JIRA, which leverages GenAI to auto-generate high-quality, standardized JIRA tickets, improving consistency and saving time across teams. Both solutions reflect innovative thinking and practical application of automation and GenAI to solve real engineering challenges.
