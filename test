In our Corporate Actions processing platform, we faced challenges with premature ingestion of events—often before key dates or complete data were available—causing unnecessary load on the system and burdening users with early checklists and alerts. To address this, I led the design and delivery of Event Resolver, an intelligent event quality gate. It applies configurable business rules to assess whether an event is ready for processing or should be held in a queue. This reduced unnecessary system load, improved data quality, and allowed users to focus only on actionable, timely events—placing user efficiency and clarity at the center of the solution.
