Hereâ€™s a combined version that incorporates both aspects:

> When writing code, I focus on avoiding the reinvention of the wheel by using existing solutions where possible. I aim to balance long-term scalability with immediate, tactical solutions, embracing a "move fast, break things" mindset. For code reviews, I prefer pair programming and in-person discussions, allowing for immediate feedback and deeper understanding of design and implementation decisions. This approach fosters collaboration and ensures high-quality, efficient code.

Does this version work for you?
