Thanks, that’s an important nuance. Here’s a revised version that includes your strategic alignment in DevOps:

> I lead architecture and design decisions for my project while actively contributing through hands-on coding. I also drive our DevOps practices with a focus on aligning technical operations—such as CI/CD, automation, and infrastructure—with the broader strategic goals of the firm. Additionally, I help shape team direction and mentor junior engineers to build their technical and problem-solving capabilities.

Would you like to mention any specific technologies or tools you work with?
