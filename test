I’m an expert in Java (15 years), with extensive experience in system design, optimization, and performance tuning. I also have strong expertise in DevOps (CI/CD, Kubernetes, Docker) and data engineering (Apache Spark, Hadoop, PostgreSQL). I’m proficient in Python for scalable applications and Golang for microservices and performance-focused tasks.
